Openness is often perceived as a business risk, but I look at it differently.

When you are open, you are more broadly accountable for your work, and your craft is at stake, so people show the best version of themselves.

When you are open, people can build trust through your work and not through third-party auditing companies and certificates. If you had anything to hide, you wouldn't open it.

When you are open, you can invite external people to contribute, which means a diversity of ideas flowing into the project, which leads to better solutions.

When you are open, anyone can find the information they need to have the agency to make decisions. The organization is more agile.

When you are open, people might end up using your work without paying for it, not worrying about complying with it legally, but those who wouldn't have paid for the software in the first place become evangelists instead.

When you are open, you inspire others to create more open businesses on commodities you might have created.

When you are open, you might make some people uncomfortable, but they decide to go a different path. 

We chose This one for Tuist because we want to build a different type of companyâ€”openness for the win.
