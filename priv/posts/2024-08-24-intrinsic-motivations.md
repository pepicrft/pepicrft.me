Have you listened to Lex Fridman's [most recent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFtjKbXKqbg) with [@levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio)? If not, I’d recommend giving it a listen.

I've been following Pieter for some time, and I really appreciate his ability to cut through the noise and focus on what truly matters. This is a skill I find difficult to acquire, partly due to the many years I’ve spent perfecting software craftsmanship, which often leads me to [analysis paralysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis). You know, before you build that tech piece, you have to find the perfect technology, set up continuous integration, choose the right framework, and by the time you have everything set up, you've lost the motivation to build the actual product. I’ve been there many times, and if you’re a software craftsman like me, I’m sure you’ve experienced it too.

You can’t imagine how many times I’ve wondered if I should be more scrappy in my work, focusing on making money quickly and monetizing the skills I’ve acquired over the years. I even feel guilty at times for not doing so. Am I foolish or what, Pedro? You might be like those people who are always waiting for the perfect moment to start a business and capitalize on the frenzy of the ecosystem, because if you don’t, someone else will. All that open-source work I’ve done is great, but it doesn’t pay the bills. That’s a mental struggle I often go through, especially when I see indie hackers like Pieter Levels discussing their MRRs and how they’re making a living from their work.

But you know what? My conclusion is often the same: I’m not like them. **My motivations are intrinsic**, and this is something I can’t ignore. When I hear them talk about people as mere tools for making money, I can’t help but feel disgusted. I know we live in a capitalist society and money is important, but I view it as a result of the work I do in supporting others, not as the sole goal.

The best technologies we’ve seen were created by people who worked for fun and were intrinsically motivated: [Linux](https://www.linux.org), [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org), [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and many others. If you ask me, that’s the kind of technology I want to build—one that leaves a lasting impact on the world and inspires others to do the same. The challenge is achieving this in a world where we are increasingly selling the image that we should be obsessed with money and fame. Those who chase extrinsic motivations often find it has a unique momentum that can’t be stopped. Microsoft [knows it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta).

So yeah, it’s tricky being an intrinsically motivated person in an extrinsically motivated environment, but the happiness of doing what you love is worth it.
