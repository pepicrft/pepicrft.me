Businesses are about maximizing the revenue versus cost tradeoff.
They generate revenue by producing value in a market, and the tech industry, like no other, can do so with much less cost thanks to the close to [zero marginal cost](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-38823-2_3) of software.

However, markets have a ceiling, and even though software has close to zero marginal costs, your software business might require humans, who are expensiveâ€”very expensive. And this is something hyper-growth business models are incompatible with.

Executives at major tech companies have found the perfect tool to work around the problem: AI. _"We are AI-first companies,"_ [they say](https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers). It'll often be used to eliminate human costs, such as support teams. In other cases, like Duolingo, they'll use it to break through the market ceiling. _"We need AI to scale learning"_, they said. What they really meant is that they need AI to [dropship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shipping) slop courses to continue exploiting humans feeling of learning progress because they complete streaks. 

If you think you are indispensable in this new mission of AI-first companies, let me tell you something: it is mostly storytelling. You are digging your grave because you are a cost to the company, and your next performance review will be in the hands of LLMs. _"Let us know why you can't do this with AI"_ is the new mantra. This continues with a _"don't worry, this is about empowering you"_ so that you don't wake up from the dream of the company's mission. Once again, the ultimate goal of a company is to maximize profit; the ultimate goal of a hyper-growth company is to do so at all costs, including your empowerment or well-being.

Good luck to those companies that want to create companies where humans are dispensable. The challenges we face require more humans and more collaboration, not less, which only benefits a few. And yes, that means we can't work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so what? If this will be the new trend, I'm not on that camp, sorry.
