title: Hitting memory limits deploying Vapor apps to Fly
description: "Deploying a Vapor app to Fly encountered unexpected issues. Swift's linter requires more memory than Fly's 2048 MB limit. Scaling via fly scale didn't solve the problem. Workaround: built locally with Docker, then pushed to Fly's image registry for deployment."

I've been trying to deploy a [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) app to [Fly](https://fly.io), and the deploy command continuously aborted unexpectedly.
It turns out that Swift's static linter needs more memory than the one available in the builders that Fly provides, 2048 MB.
I tried to increase the memory using `fly scale` as suggested in the community forum, but it didn't work.
Perhaps because the scale command cannot be used with the builder.
I used the `--local-only` flag to build locally using my local running instance of Docker.
Once the image is built,
the Fly CLI pushes it to its image registry and continues the deployment.
