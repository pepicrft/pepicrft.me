I spent a fair amount of time today trying to get Docker DinD working in Forgejo Actions, so I thought I'd share the steps for my future self or anyone running into a similar need.

If you want to build a Docker image from Forgejo Actions when using Docker as a runner, you'll have to use [Docker-in-Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/docker-in-docker-containerized-ci-workflows-dockercon-2023/).

## Steps

1. The first thing you'll need to do is enable `privileged` mode when launching task containers. This is done by setting the attribute `container.privileged` to `true` in your runner's `config.yml` file.

   **Note:** This has security implications, so use it with caution. Before running actions for external contributions, ensure that they are not malicious.

2. Once you've made this change, restart the runner.

3. The next step is configuring your pipeline to start a sidecar service with Docker DinD:

```language-yaml
name: MyProject
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request: {}
jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build image
    runs-on: debian-latest
    container:
      image: node:20-bookworm
      options: >-
        --privileged
      env:
        DOCKER_HOST: "tcp://docker:2375"
        DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
    services:
      docker:
        image: docker:24.0.5-dind
        options: >-
          --privileged
        env:
          DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install Docker
        run: |
          apt-get update
          apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg
          install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
          curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
          chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
          # Add the repository to Apt sources:
          echo \
            "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
            $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
            tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
          apt-get update
          apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
      - name: Build image
        run: |
          docker build -t my-project .
```

**Note:** The above pipeline is designed for Debian as the OS, so you might need to tweak it according to your specific requirements.

That's all you need. The `--privileged` flag is one of the most important elements - without it, things simply won't work.
