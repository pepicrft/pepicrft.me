I've noticed that I often try to hold more in my mind than I can handle.

When I have an open PR waiting for review, I start working on something else, but that PR still lingers in my thoughts. If, while working on the new task, a Slack message comes through, I pause what I'm doing to respond, all while keeping track of the pause so I can return to it. If an idea pops into my head, I let it simmer for a bit. On days when I let my brain juggle multiple things like this, I end up feeling mentally exhausted.

So, what am I doing to manage this? I’m practicing holding fewer things in my mind by using a queue system. When I finish a task, like reviewing a PR, I add it to the queue. If a new idea comes up, I put it in a queue for later. If a support request comes in, I queue that as well. Instead of a single queue, I have multiple ones, and I allocate specific time slots for each. My email inbox is a queue that I only process once a day. The same goes for support issues and PRs. I don’t let them distract me throughout the day.

The downside to this approach is that it can feel like working on a production line—doing one thing after another until the day is over. What about the creative work our brains thrive on? I make sure to leave space for that too. The chain-like tasks are important but often not the most exciting. Creative work, on the other hand, is the most exciting but doesn't always have an immediate impact on the project at hand. Balancing these two types of work is key to maintaining my mental well-being, and I’m continuously working on finding that balance.

What about you? How do you manage your mental input and workload?
