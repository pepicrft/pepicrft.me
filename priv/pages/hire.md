## Who I am

I’m open to new opportunities from Germany, **preferably as a contractor**, although I’m open to employment depending on the organization. I have a **generalist** profile with a **problem-oriented** mindset and an interest in **developer productivity, tooling, and platforms**. I conceive programming languages as tools to solve problems and, therefore, can learn new ones more suitable for the problem at hand. I’m most familiar with programming languages Typescript, Javascript, Ruby, Elixir, and Swift.

You can [download](/pdfs/CV.pdf) my full CV.
## What I'm looking for

I’m looking for projects or organizations with a well-defined problem space in which they’ve built a **sustainable product that delivers** value to its users. The organization must be diverse, built around trust, and mindful of the laws of Germany.
I’m hesitant about unicorn projects that are a solution to a non-existing problem, and anything related to Web3 or Blockchain.

## What I can help you with

Being a generalist makes one’s role harder to understand for organizations that lean over more specific roles, so I’m including here a list of areas I could help your organization with:

- **Audit and improve the productivity of your developer:**  I can help you identify where the performance bottlenecks lay, develop metrics and monitors, and implement improvements (e.g., slow and inconsistent environment setup when jumping across repos).
- **Create a developer platform for your product:** If you’ve built a successful product and are considering building a developer platform for third-party developers to extend your business domain, I can help you plan and execute it. Developer platforms are an excellent way to adapt your product to various cultures.
- **Advise on and develop Shopify Apps:** As the first developer of the [Shopify Node CLI](https://shopify.engineering/overhauling-shopify-cli-for-a-better-developer-experience) I have an in-depth knowledge of the tool and the platform. If you are building an app and would like to consult me or get some help with the development, I’m open to that.
- **Adopt [Tuist](https://tuist.io) in your Xcode project:** As the creator of Tuist, I have in-depth knowledge on the tool. I can help you migrate the project, set up remote caching, and contribute new features and improvements to the tool on behalf of your organization.
- **Devise and build developer tools:** I am comfortable building developer tools of any nature (e.g., CLIs, web services, infrastructure). If you've identified a tool that would be useful but need more resources to build it internally, I can help with that. I can also help integrate third-party services and tools with internal ones.
- **Lead technical projects:** I can help teams identify upcoming problems and challenges and develop a plan to support the business’ direction. I feel comfortable jumping into uncertain problem spaces, solving them, and building a team around them. I'm also a person whose contagious passion creates bonds and healthy team dynamics.
