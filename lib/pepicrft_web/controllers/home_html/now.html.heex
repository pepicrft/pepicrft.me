  I'm working on better understanding my emotions and reverting some anxiety-inducing habits that I've developed over the years.

  I'm learning a lot about business while trying to build a company upon the open-source work that I've been doing for the past few years. It's a whole new world of ideas of concepts for me, but I'm quite liking it. It reminds me of my childhood working at my family cafe, but at a different scale.

<p>
  I haven't worked much with the web in the past, and whenever I did, it was mostly to build my personal website by using a template, a static site generator, and working with many abstractions (e.g. TailwindCSS). This time, I'm playing with the web in its most raw formâ€“writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I'm getting familiar with the semantics of HTML elements, as well as the common CSS properties.

<p>
  As part of my work on Tuist, I'm learning a lot about Elixir, and the more I learn, the more I like it. I'm fascinated by the language's simplicity and the way it leverages the Erlang VM to build robust and fault-tolerant systems. I'm also learning about OTP, the framework that Elixir provides to build distributed systems.
